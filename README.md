# In Search Of Shotgun Parsers In Android Applications - All The Graphs

Here you can find the path length histograms for all 55 applications tested as part of the work described in "In Search of Shotgun Parsers In Android Applications" by Katherine Underwood and Michael Locasto, to appear in the proceedings of the LangSec Workshop at IEEE Security & Privacy, May 2016.

Each histogram displays the frequency with which different (normalized) path length occur. Note that the axes are not the same for each plot - each axis was chosen to best represent the data range being displayed.

Graphs are separated by application category.
